-- VuzitCL - Vuzit Command Line
--------------------------------------------------

VuzitCL is a command line program for the Web Services Library:

  http://vuzit.com/developer/documents_api 
  
VuzitCL was created for developers and non-developers to be able to automate 
the upload, viewing and deletion of documents from their Vuzit 
(http://vuzit.com/) web account.  

--------------------------------------------------
-- OPTIONS
--------------------------------------------------

When you run VuzitCL without any options it will give you the list of options 
seen below.  Several examples of how to use these commands is listed in the 
later sections.  

<pre>
<code>

</pre>

-- UPLOAD EXAMPLES
--------------------------------------------------

Below is an example of how to upload a file to Vuzit.  Replace PUBLIC_KEY and 
PRIVATE_KEY with your personal Vuzit developer public and private keys 
respectively.  Notice the comma (",") between the two keys.  You can sign up 
to get your keys from Vuzit here: https://ssl.vuzit.com/signup.  

<pre>
<code>
vuzitcl -k PUBLIC_KEY,PRIVATE_KEY -u "c:/temp/test.pdf"
</code>
</pre>

The output of that command if successful is below.  

<pre>
<code>
UPLOADED: abc123 </code>
</pre>

The "abc123" is an example of the document ID.  The ID is the unique identifier 
for the document in the Vuzit document system.  You can use this ID to load or 
delete the document later.  

Below is the same example of how to upload a file to Vuzit but to make the file 
public (using the -p flag).  

<pre>
<code>
vuzitcl -k PUBLIC_KEY,PRIVATE_KEY -u "c:/temp/test.pdf" -p
</code>
</pre>

--------------------------------------------------
-- LOAD EXAMPLE
--------------------------------------------------

Below is an example of how to load the data from a document.  In this example 
we'll use that made up "abc123" document ID.  

<pre>
<code>
vuzitcl -k PUBLIC_KEY,PRIVATE_KEY -l abc123
</code>
</pre>

This is some sample output that you'll see:

<pre>
<code>
LOADED: abc123
title: Some sample title
subject: Sample subject
pages: 13
width: 595
height: 842
size: 29730
</code>
</pre>

--------------------------------------------------
-- DELETE EXAMPLE
--------------------------------------------------

Below is an example of how to delete a document.  In this example we'll use 
the "abc123" document ID we created earlier.  

<pre>
<code>
vuzitcl -k PUBLIC_KEY,PRIVATE_KEY -d abc123
</code>
</pre>

This is some sample output that you'll see if successful:

<pre>
<code>
DELETED: abc123
</code>
</pre>

--------------------------------------------------
-- USING WITH YOUR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
--------------------------------------------------

Vuzit already has support for programming languages like PHP
(http://wiki.github.com/vuzit/vuzitphp) and Ruby 
(http://wiki.github.com/vuzit/vuzitruby) so it's recommended that you use 
these.  However if your language is not currently supported then you can use 
VuzitCL to handle it.  

Below are a few libraries that allow programmers to run external applications.  

* .NET: Process Start() method
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.process.start(VS.71).aspx

* Java: java.lang.Runtime exec() method
  http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html#exec(java.lang.String)

* Python: subprocess
  http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html

* Perl: exec() or system() functions
  http://perl.about.com/od/programmingperl/qt/perlexecsystem.htm

-- SPECIAL THANKS
--------------------------------------------------

Thanks to Erik Veenstra for his RubyScript2Exe 
(http://www.erikveen.dds.nl/rubyscript2exe/) which made it possible to write 
this application natively for Windows and Linux without the need for a Ruby interpreter.
